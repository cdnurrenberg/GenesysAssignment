## Project Initialization

I'm kickstarting this application project with a quick and simple

`npx create-react-app --template cra-template-typescript`

and cleaning up from there.

I attempted getting this to work on my older "work" laptop but that's still on Windows7... the upgrade tool for windows 10 does not run and gives vague error messages, so I'm having to take a lot of time setting up my current personal computer for this project's development.
