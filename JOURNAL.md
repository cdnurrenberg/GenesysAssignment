## Project Initialization

I'm kickstarting this application project with a quick and simple

`npx create-react-app --template cra-template-typescript`

and cleaning up from there.

I attempted getting this to work on my older school laptop but that's still on Windows7... the upgrade tool for windows 10 does not run and gives vague error messages, so I'm having to take a lot of time setting up my current personal computer for this project's development.

## First Steps
I first setup a rudimentary API layer for the front end to connect to so I had some access to the data. Just a simple snag-all-500-stories so I could get some data displaying on the page, then refine from there.

First priority on the actual client side was coming up with a more modern look for the stories, since that's the main way people engage with the site (in this assignment's scope). The current design is too compact, and doesn't give enough immediate info to the user as to what everything is (link, button, redirect, etc).
